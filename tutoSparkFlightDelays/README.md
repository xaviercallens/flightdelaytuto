# Tuto Azure ML Flight Delays

If you are here, you are supposed to be login into Azure

1. Create a Ressource called Azure Machine Learning

2. Create a workspace called flights-mlbox in North Europe 

* Select a ressource group or create one

* Leave all the values as they are

* Click on Review + Create

* Wait for Review

* Create the ressource (Might take few minutes)

3. When it is fully deploy

* Press Ressource and launch Studio

4. Go to compute on the nav bar (the nav bar might be hidden and you have to open completely to select the good icon) in the left, and start a Compute Instance. Create a machine CPU (lowest cost) called compute-ntbk-X (X is a random number because Azure does not allow 2 computes machine that has the same name in the same region)

5. This machine is used to compute the notebook from the tutorial. Later on we will create a Compute Cluster that will run our pipeline

6. Wait for the compute to start (Could take 5 mn to start)

7. Go in Notebooks on the nav bar in the left and start a terminal (compute has to be ready to do so)

8. Clone this repository 

```
git clone https://github.com/xaviercallens/flightdelaytuto.git
```

9. Refresh the page

10. Select Kernel Azure ML 3.8

12. Click on the folder that has your name on it and click on flightdelaytuto folder and go on the tuto you want to start (tutoAzureML is the Second tuto)
